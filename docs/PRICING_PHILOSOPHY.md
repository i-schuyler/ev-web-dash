# Pricing Philosophy

## Purpose

This document explains **why pricing exists** for this project and how it is applied.

It is not a price list.
It is a statement of values and constraints.

---

## The Short Version

This project charges for **stability**, not for access to ideas.

Exploration is free.
Predictability is not.

---

## What Is Free — By Design

The Development channel is intentionally:

* Public
* Open-source
* Free to use

Anyone can:

* Inspect the code
* Modify it
* Experiment with it
* Learn from it

This is not a trial.
This is a real, complete system intended for experimentation and contribution.

The project does not hide functionality behind a paywall.

---

## Why Stability Has a Price

Stability is not the absence of change.

Stability is **ongoing discipline**.

Providing Stable releases requires:

* Saying "no" to features that are not ready
* Testing upgrade paths
* Maintaining documentation accuracy
* Avoiding breaking changes
* Designing conservative defaults

This work takes time, attention, and restraint.

Pricing exists to support that restraint.

---

## What You Are Not Paying For

A Stable license does **not** buy:

* Faster feature development
* Exclusive functionality
* Priority over other users
* Artificial scarcity

Features are developed in the open.
Stability is applied later.

---

## What You Are Paying For

A Stable license supports:

* Predictable behavior across versions
* Confidence when tuning parameters
* Safe firmware updates
* Reduced risk of regressions
* Documentation that matches reality

In short:

> You are paying to not be surprised.

---

## Why This Is Not SaaS

This project does not:

* Require accounts
* Require subscriptions to function
* Require an Internet connection
* Phone home
* Rent access to your own vehicle

Licensing applies to **distribution of Stable builds**, not runtime behavior.

Once installed, the system operates independently.

---

## Why This Is Not Rent-Seeking

Rent-seeking extracts value without creating it.

This pricing model exists to:

* Sustain careful maintenance
* Support long-term compatibility
* Keep the Development channel open
* Avoid pressure to ship unstable features

If pricing ever undermines those goals, it has failed.

---

## Pricing and Responsibility

Vehicles are safety-relevant systems.

With that responsibility comes a duty to:

* Reduce avoidable risk
* Communicate limits clearly
* Avoid silent behavior changes

Stable pricing exists to align incentives with that duty.

---

## Choosing Not to Pay

Choosing not to purchase a Stable license is valid.

You can:

* Use the Development channel indefinitely
* Fork the project
* Modify it for your own use

No functionality is revoked.

Only guarantees are.

---

## Closing Statement

This project believes:

* Openness builds trust
* Stability requires care
* Care deserves support

Pricing exists to keep those three in balance.
