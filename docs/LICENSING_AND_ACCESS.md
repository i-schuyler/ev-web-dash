# Licensing & Access

## Purpose

This document explains **how access works** for this project and why two release channels exist.

It is intended to be read alongside the **Stability Promise**.

This is not a legal document. It describes usage expectations and project boundaries in plain language.

---

## Two Channels, Two Intentions

This project maintains two parallel channels:

* **Development (Open)** — for learning, experimentation, and collaboration
* **Stable (Licensed)** — for dependable, real‑world vehicle use

Both channels are legitimate. They simply serve different needs.

---

## Development (Open) Channel

The Development channel is:

* Public
* Open‑source
* Free to use

It is intended for:

* Developers and contributors
* Experimental builds
* Learning and exploration
* Custom or research vehicles

There are **no guarantees** of stability, compatibility, or long‑term behavior.

If you are comfortable debugging, rebuilding firmware, or recovering from misconfiguration, this channel is for you.

---

## Stable (Licensed) Channel

The Stable channel is intended for vehicles that:

* Must start reliably
* Represent significant financial or safety investment
* Are used daily or shared with others

Access to Stable releases requires a paid license.

The license provides:

* Access to Stable firmware releases
* Versioned, predictable behavior
* Alignment with the Stability Promise

The license does **not** provide:

* Custom features on request
* Priority feature development
* Guaranteed support response times (unless explicitly offered elsewhere)

---

## What You Are Paying For

A Stable license pays for **restraint**.

Specifically:

* Features ship later, not sooner
* Breaking changes are avoided
* Documentation is kept accurate
* Risk is reduced intentionally

You are not paying to unlock hidden functionality.
You are paying to avoid surprises.

---

## License Scope

Licenses are typically scoped to one of the following (exact terms may vary by release):

* Per vehicle
* Per controller
* Per organization or shop

Licenses are non‑transferable unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

## Choosing the Right Channel

Choose **Development** if:

* You enjoy experimentation
* You are building something unique
* You can tolerate instability

Choose **Stable** if:

* You value predictability
* Your vehicle must be dependable
* You want tuning behavior to match documentation exactly

There is no wrong choice—only an honest one.

---

## Relationship to Open Source

This project believes that:

* Openness builds trust
* Stability requires discipline

The Development channel ensures transparency.
The Stable channel ensures dependability.

Both are necessary.

---

## Closing Statement

This licensing model exists to respect both curiosity and responsibility.

If you want to explore freely, you can.
If you want calm and predictable behavior, you can choose that too.

No functionality is hidden.
Only guarantees are.
